dotfiles for my System76 Adder WS. I made this as an archive for future me, which is why its public just in case I lose acess to this account.
If you're just a random person, you can still use my waybar dot files if you'd like. it is pretty cool.
dont bother with copy and pasting the WHOLE hyprland config though. because I didnt change much besides the border colors.
